      <p><strong>&lt;hello&gt;</strong></p>

      <div class="tabbed">
        <p>I'm Ashlyn. I'm a news applications developer at the <a href="http://www.myajc.com/" target="_blank">Atlanta Journal-Constitution.</a> I get to tell impactful stories in interesting ways every day – whether it be with color, with code, with data or with design. I'm obsessed with what I do.</p>

        <p>Before joining the AJC full time, I earned a bachelor's degree from the School of Journalism and Mass Communication at UNC-Chapel Hill. While in the journalism school, I experimented with entrepreneurial journalism in the <a href="http://reesenewslab.org/" target="_blank">Reese News Lab</a>, built an <a href="http://livinggalapagos.org/" target="_blank">award-winning website</a> in the Galapagos Islands about the Galapagos Islands, and helped to restart the student chapter of the Online News Association. I was also the summer interactive graphics intern at the AJC in 2012.</p>

        <p>I love being a news nerd. Right now, I'm really interested in mobile design + development, audio + visual storytelling, experimental storyforms, and data visualization. I'm an ENTJ – I'm pushy, I'm passionate, I'm ambitious, I love a good challenge and most of all, I'm crazy excited about the future of journalism.</p>

        <p>Outside of work, my tennis leagues, my kickball team and my sassy miniature schnauzer, Sophie, keep me busy. I'm learning calligraphy and I'm working on my mandolin skills. I love Carolina basketball, Carolina beaches, good music and good bourbon. I love to talk – I'm always up for a cup of coffee and a conversation.</p>

        <p><strong>Excellent</strong> with HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, d3.js, responsive design, mapping libraries such as Mapbox and Leafleft, git, Adobe Photoshop + Illustrator</p>
        <p><strong>Proficient</strong> in Node.js, Grunt, Bower, Ruby + Ruby on Rails, MySQL, GIS</p>
        <p><strong>Working knowledge</strong> of Python + Django, MVC javascript frameworks (most experienced with Backbone + Marionette)
        </p><p><strong>Lately I've been interested in...</strong> node.js and finding ways to streamline the development process in the newsroom. Automating large chunks of my development process with Grunt, Bower and grunt-init scaffolding. Building static site generators and grunt plugins to bake out flat files from web databases and Google docs. Bots for journalism!</p>

          <strong>Newsroom & team tools:</strong> I've been building a lot of internal tools lately, for both news app team use and for newsroom reporter & editor use. I've started putting together an <a href="https://github.com/newsappajc/digital-design-guide" target="_blank">AJC digital design guide</a> for the news app team to implement consistent styling that matches our print styles. I've taken a front-end project template built by a coworker that utilized grunt as a task manager and bower as a dependency manager, enhanced the template, and built a <a href="https://github.com/NewsappAJC/project-template-generator" target="_blank">grunt-init template generator</a> around it to scaffold out a front-end codebase everyone can use. I've also built two grunt plugins to pull data from external sources and convert to JSON to work with in the project template – <a href="https://github.com/NewsappAJC/grunt-google-archieml" target="_blank">grunt-google-archieml</a> parses Google Docs using ArchieML and <a href="https://github.com/newsappajc/sql-bakery" target="_blank">grunt-sql-bakery</a> connects to sql databases and pulls down json from any tables or views you configure to your grunt project. For newsroom use, I built a tool called <a href="http://ajc-producer-tools.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/quoteit/" target="_blank">QuoteIt</a>, largely inspired by NPR Visuals' Quotable tool (and inspired by their open sourced code), which allows for anyone in the newsroom to create shareable quote images to go with their stories on social media platforms without having to install Photoshop or the AJC brand fonts on their computers.

          <strong>news applications:</strong> The AJC's home for Atlanta crime data, <a href="http://crime.myajc.com/" target="_blank">Crime in ATL</a>, was designed, developed, researched and is maintained by me. I built the Ruby on Rails app that scrapes the Atlanta Police Department website nightly, stores the data in a MySQL database and renders the data in a REST API. The API is then interpreted by a separate single-page javascript application I built using Backbone & Marionette to power the front-end of the site. The <a href="http://legislativenavigator.myajc.com/" target="_blank">Georgia Legislative Navigator</a> is built in a similar fashion – Ruby on Rails API to emit the data, Backbone/Marionette application powering the front-end – but I only contributed to the front-end design and some of the development for the legislative navigator over the last two legislative sessions.

          <strong>longform story packages:</strong> My first longform interactive project, <a href="http://battleofatlanta.myajc.com/" target="_blank">War in our backyards</a>, was also one of my most successful. I researched the historical data (with some assistance), and designed and developed the entire site (with the exception of most of the map page, which was built by another developer). <em>War in our backyards</em> won an SND Award of Excellence, won "Best Multi-platform Coverage of a Single Story" and was chosen as "Story of the Year" at the 2015 Georgia APME Awards, and was a finalist at the 2015 Atlanta Press Club awards. Another project I designed and developed alongside another AJC news apps team member, <a href="http://memories.myajc.com/" target="_blank">Forgotten Memories</a>, also racked up a few awards this year; the project received an SND award of excellence, was a finalist at the Atlanta Press Club awards, and was awarded a first place prize for integrated storytelling by the Society of Features Journalism. More recently, I've been designing and developing smaller story packages, like this <a href="http://investigations.myajc.com/prison-medicine/womens-deaths-add-concerns/" target="_blank">investigation surrounding a Georgia prison doctor.</a></p>
        
        <p>
          <strong>graphics + data viz:</strong> Data visualization is a large part of my job, but often results in not-so-exciting simple charts, graphs and maps. Here's a few examples of the more interesting graphics and visualizations I've built. Following the Charleston shooting in June 2015, I worked with our team's summer intern to design and develop this <a href="http://specialprojects.myajc.com/graphics/mass-shootings/" target="_blank">mass shootings</a> package of visualizations exploring a half century of shootings, using data collected by the Stanford's Geospatial Center. This <a href="http://atlantaforward.myajc.com/" target="_blank">Atlanta Forward</a> package compares Atlanta "by the numbers" with Charlotte and Dallas, and was published at the start of a year-long initiative looking at the current state of Atlanta's growth and development in comparison to the rest of the nation. The first project I published at the AJC as a news apps developer was an <a href="http://www.myajc.com/news/exploring-obamacare/" target="_blank">Exploring Obamacare</a> "choose your own adventure" tool to let readers explore how the Obamacare subsides and the healthcare marketplace would effect them.
